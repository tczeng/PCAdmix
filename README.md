# PCAdmix
Rapid Estimation of Admixture Coefficients Using Linear Optimisation

This script runs in ipython notebooks to produce STRUCTURE-like visualisations of admixture coefficients calculated by linear optimisation on PCA data. A sample PCA format is provided in the file "Global_25_PCA_pop_averages_scaled.txt".
